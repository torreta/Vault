1. The update function is checking whether the form has been submitted by looking at the params hash. It starts by checking if params[:commit] is present. If it is, it means the form has been submitted.

2. he function then initializes a few variables, like i, j, k, array, array_schedule_app, array_hours, delete_addresses, delete_business_hours, address_id, header, @ids_addresses, @ids_business_hours, @address, @busi, @delete_business_hour_result, and @delete_address_result.

3. It then enters a loop that iterates over the addresses in the form. For each address, it does the following:

a. Checks if the address already exists by looking at params["idC#{i}"]. If it does, it means the address is being updated, not created.

b. If the address is being updated, it gets its ID and retrieves the existing address and business hours from the database.

c. It then enters a loop that iterates over the business hours for each address. For each business hour, it does the following:

i. Checks if the business hour is being deleted by looking at params["deleteC#{j}#{k}"]. If it is, it deletes the business hour.

ii. If the business hour is not being deleted, it updates the business hour with the new information from the form.

d. After all business hours have been updated, it enters a loop that iterates over the new business hours in the form. For each new business hour, it does the following:

i. Checks if the new business hour is being added by looking at params["newC#{j}#{k}"]. If it is, it creates the new business hour.

ii. It then creates a new business hour with the information from the form.

4. After all addresses and business hours have been updated or created, it enters a loop that deletes any extra addresses or business hours that were removed from the form.

5. Finally, it redirects the user to the edit page with a success message.
